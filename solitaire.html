  <h1>🃏 La Croix d'Honneur – Easy Rules (Solitaire)</h1>
  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>La Croix d'Honneur</strong> is a solitaire (single-player) card game. The aim is to get rid of all cards by pairing them in matching ranks (for example two Kings, two 5s, etc.).</p>
  </div>
  <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
  <p>Discard all cards by removing them in pairs of the same rank. If you succeed — i.e. no cards remain — you win!</p>
  <h2>✴️ Layout (the "Cross")</h2>
  <p>The game starts with cards arranged in a special cross shape — an <strong>inner circle and an outer circle</strong>, each with 8 cards (so 16 cards total laid out).</p>

  <p>The rest of the cards form a face-down stock (draw pile).</p>
  <h2>🃏 How to Play – Stages</h2>
  <h3>1. First Stage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You may only pair the <strong>top card of the waste pile</strong> (cards you draw and discard) with any of the cards in the <strong>inner circle</strong>.</li>
    <li>When an inner-circle card is paired and removed, it is immediately replaced by the corresponding card from the <strong>outer circle</strong>. Cards from the outer circle are not replaced once removed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. Second Stage (after stock runs out)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Once you have drawn all cards from the stock, you may use the waste-pile cards to fill empty spaces in the inner circle (but not necessarily all empty spaces).</li>
    <li>The rule still applies: only the top card of the waste pile may be paired — and only with a card from the inner circle.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. Final Stage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>When no cards remain in the waste pile (either discarded or moved into the inner circle), you can pair cards from the inner circle among themselves.</li>
    <li>No redeal — you only use the cards you already have laid out.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>🏆 Winning the Game</h2>
  <p>You win when <strong>all cards are discarded</strong> — meaning there are no cards left anywhere.</p>
  <h2>💡 Tips for Playing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep an eye on the top of the waste pile — it's your only chance to pair until later stages.</li>
    <li>Try to remove cards from the inner circle quickly to expose more outer-circle cards (more options).</li>
    <li>Be careful: once outer-circle cards are used, no more replacements — plan ahead!.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Brief History</h2>
  <p>Solitaire games have been played for hundreds of years. La Croix d'Honneur is a classic version from France, and solitaire games are loved around the world for their relaxing and thoughtful play!</p>
