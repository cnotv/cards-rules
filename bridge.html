    <h1>🌉 How to Play Bridge 🌉</h1>
    <p>Bridge is the ultimate team game! It is played 2 vs 2. Partners sit across from each other (North/South vs East/West).</p>

    <h2>🎯 The Goal</h2>
    <p>To work with your partner to win "Tricks." A trick is a round where everyone plays one card.</p>

    <h2>🗣️ Part 1: The Bidding (The Conversation)</h2>
    <p>Before you play cards, you have to talk! But you can only talk using numbers and suits.</p>
    <div class="concept-box">
        <p><strong>The Contract:</strong> You are guessing how many tricks your team can win out of 13.</p>
        <p>If you say <strong>"1 Heart"</strong>, you promise to win 7 tricks (6 + 1) with Hearts as the boss suit (Trump).</p>
        <p>The highest bid decides the rules for the game!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>⚔️ Part 2: The Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The person who won the bid is the "Declarer." Their partner is the "Dummy" (they lay their cards face up on the table and do whatever the Declarer says!).</li>
        <li><strong>Lead:</strong> Player to the left starts by playing a card.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Suit:</strong> If they play a Heart <span class="suits">♥</span>, you MUST play a Heart if you have one.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The highest card played wins the trick! (Ace is high, 2 is low).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>👑 The Power of Trump</h2>
    <p>Remember the bid? If Hearts are <strong>Trump</strong>, they are the Super Suit. </p>
    <p>If you don't have the suit that was led (like Spades), you can play a Trump (Heart) to zap the other cards and win the trick!</p>

    <h2>🏆 Scoring</h2>
    <p>If you promised to win 9 tricks and you won 9 or more, your team gets points! If you fail, the other team gets points. It's high risk, high reward!</p>

    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>Bridge evolved from older card games like Whist in the 19th century. It became popular worldwide in the 20th century and is now played in clubs and tournaments everywhere. Bridge is known for its teamwork and strategy!</p>
