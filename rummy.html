    <h1>🂡 How to Play Rummy 🂡</h1>
    <p>Rummy is a game about collecting matching cards. It's like a puzzle where you have to organize your hand!</p>

    <h2>🎯 The Goal</h2>
    <p>To be the first person to get rid of all your cards by grouping them into <strong>Sets</strong> or <strong>Runs</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🃏 The Groups (Melds)</h2>
    <p>You are trying to make two types of groups:</p>
    
    <div class="card-example">
        <strong>1. A Set (Three of a Kind):</strong><br>
        Three or four cards of the same number.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> 7♥, 7♠, 7♦
    </div>

    <div class="card-example">
        <strong>2. A Run (A Sequence):</strong><br>
        Three or more cards of the same suit in a row.<br>
        <em>Example:</em> 4, 5, 6 of Hearts ♥
    </div>

    <h2>🎮 How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Deal:</strong> Everyone gets 7 to 10 cards (depending on how many players). Put the rest face down (the Draw Pile). Flip one card face up (the Discard Pile).</li>
        <li><strong>Start your turn:</strong> You MUST take a card. You can take the top one from the hidden Draw Pile <strong>OR</strong> the top one from the face-up Discard Pile.</li>
        <li><strong>Meld (Optional):</strong> If you have a group (Set or Run), you can place it face up on the table. You can also add cards to groups other players played!</li>
        <li><strong>End your turn:</strong> You MUST throw away one card onto the Discard Pile.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🏆 How to Win</h2>
    <p>The moment you put your last card on the table (or discard your last card), shout <strong>"RUMMY!"</strong> You win the round!</p>

    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>Rummy is a family of card games that started in the early 1900s. It is played all over the world and has many versions. Rummy is famous for its easy rules and the fun of making sets and runs!</p>
