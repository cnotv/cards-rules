        <h1>How to Play Buraco</h1>
        <h2>What You Need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 decks of cards (including Jokers)</li>
            <li>2 to 4 players</li>
            <li>Paper and pencil to keep score</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Goal of the Game</h2>
        <p>Make groups of cards called "melds" to score points. The team or player with the most points at the end wins!</p>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shuffle all the cards together.</li>
            <li>Each player gets 11 cards.</li>
            <li>Make two piles of 11 cards each (these are called "pots").</li>
            <li>Put the rest of the cards in a draw pile, face down.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>On your turn:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take a card from the draw pile <em>or</em> take all cards from the discard pile.</li>
                    <li>Try to put down groups of 3 or more cards of the same number (like 7-7-7) or runs of the same suit (like 4-5-6 of hearts).</li>
                    <li>You can use Jokers and 2s as wild cards!</li>
                    <li>End your turn by putting one card on the discard pile.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you use all your cards, take a "pot" pile and keep playing.</li>
            <li>The round ends when someone uses all their cards <strong>after</strong> taking a pot.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Try to make a "Buraco"! That's a meld of 7 or more cards. It gives you extra points!
        </div>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each card has points. Jokers and 2s are worth the most!</li>
            <li>Add up your points from melds. Subtract points for cards left in your hand.</li>
            <li>The player or team with the most points after a few rounds wins!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Joker:</strong> 30 points</li>
            <li><strong>2 (wild card):</strong> 20 points</li>
            <li><strong>Ace:</strong> 15 points</li>
            <li><strong>8, 9, 10, J, Q, K:</strong> 10 points each</li>
            <li><strong>3, 4, 5, 6, 7:</strong> 5 points each</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Extra Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clean Buraco</strong> (7+ cards, no wild cards): <strong>200 points</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dirty Buraco</strong> (7+ cards, with wild cards): <strong>100 points</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Going out</strong> (using all your cards): <strong>100 points</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Try to make clean Buracos for the most points!
