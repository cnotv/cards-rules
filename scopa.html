  <h1>🃏 Scopa – Easy Rules for Kids</h1>
  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Scopa</strong> is a classic Italian card game for 2 to 4 players. The name means "broom" in Italian, because you try to "sweep" all the cards from the table!</p>
  </div>
  <h2>🎯 Goal of the Game</h2>
  <p>Try to collect the most points by picking up cards from the table. You get points for special cards and for making a "scopa" (sweeping all cards from the table in one turn)!</p>
  <h2>🃏 The Cards</h2>
  <p>Scopa uses a 40-card Italian deck. The suits are Coins, Cups, Swords, and Clubs. The cards go from 1 (Ace) to 7, then Jack, Knight, and King.</p>
  <h2>🎴 Setup</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Shuffle the deck.</li>
    <li>Deal 3 cards to each player.</li>
    <li>Place 4 cards face up on the table.</li>
    <li>The rest of the cards are set aside for the next rounds.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>▶️ How to Play</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>On your turn, play one card from your hand.</li>
    <li>If your card matches the value of a card on the table, or the sum of several cards, you take those cards and your card.</li>
    <li>If you take all the cards from the table, you make a <strong>Scopa</strong>! (That's 1 bonus point.)</li>
    <li>If you can't take any cards, just leave your card on the table.</li>
    <li>When all players run out of cards, deal 3 more to each (until the deck is gone).</li>
    <li>At the end, any cards left on the table go to the last player who took cards.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>🏆 Scoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 point for each Scopa (sweep)</li>
    <li>1 point for most cards</li>
    <li>1 point for most coins (the suit)</li>
    <li>1 point for the 7 of coins (Settebello)</li>
    <li>1 point for the best "Primiera" (highest set of 7s, 6s, Aces, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Brief History</h2>
  <p>Scopa is one of the most famous Italian card games, played for hundreds of years. It is loved by families and friends all over Italy and is easy to learn for kids and adults alike!</p>
